                <h2>About ObsCure</h2>
                <p>
                    ObsCure is a Survival Horror game from 2004 developed by French team Hydravision. In ObsCure you play as a
                    group of 5 high schoolers who lock themselves inside to look for a friend and unveil the secrets of the
                    educational center. It's a typical Survival Horror from the 2000s with fixed cameras and limited ammunition
                    and health items.

                    It's an old game, but it's still on sale on Steam, this version was developed by Mighty Rocket Studio.

                <h2>How it all started</h2>
                <p>
                    ObsCure is my favourite game of all time, and I've spent hours playing it, speedrunning it, making
                    researches, talking about it with members of the community... Knowing every detail from the game
                    has always fascinated me, so it was a matter of time that I became curious enough to go look into
                    the game files and to try to modify the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, most of the game files were packaged in several `.hvp` files. Thanks to the efforts of the
                    members of the small (yet very passionate) community, a tool for unpacking these files had already been
                    developed when I started looking into them. This allowed me to dig into the depths of ObsCure. I started
                    to take a shallow look at the files through Notepad, but they were unreadable. After that, I downloaded
                    HxD, which is a software to read the contents of a file in Hexadecimal representation, which allowed me
                    to see all the bytes in the file, even the non-printable characters. Sadly I still didn't understand it
                    so I gave up at the time. Until one day, everything changed...

                <p>
                    One day I was looking at the `allitems.it` file, which I assumed had something to do with the items that
                    you can pick up in the game (weapons, cures, etc), and which I had already tried to read a while ago,
                    but this time I had an idea. HxD shows you the hexadecimal representation in the left part of the screen
                    and the ASCII corresponding characters in the right part, and I noticed that a certain pattern seemed to
                    appear in the right side. All the printable characters seemed to be equally distant from the next one,
                    so I used the selection feature to count the distance between those bytes, which was 20, and configured
                    the hex editor to display 20 bytes per row. All of a sudden, all those values aligned themselves
                    together, and I felt like a kid who just made the biggest discovery in History.
